release.sh automates the creation of a project in the open suse build service
for a new release and it copies all the dependencies.

To be more specific, it creates a subproject in Virtualization:containers:Portus
and it copies all packages. Then, it will set the version in the spec file and
get the tarball for that specific version (it assumes you have tagged git)
